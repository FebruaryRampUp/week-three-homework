Part 1
1. Rails
	Rails automates many of the frequently used tasks when creating a web app.
	The framework uses the model-view-controller (MVC) pattern
		With this, I could create a website with appropriate login authentication and web site presentation more quickly than I could if I had to rewrite all the reused code everytime I made an app.

2. Nokogiri
	Nokogiri pulls HTML/XML documents and allows for it to be searched, modified, and parsed. (quickly extract data from raw html files)
		With nokogiri, I could pull an html page off the internet, search it, change it, parse it, all much more quickly than I could do if I was trying to do those things myself.  I could grab pages from the internet, store them, track changes, or steal the format and customize it for my own uses.
3. facebook
	OmniAuth facebook is an app taht lets users authenticate through facebook to your app and then lets them control what they share.
		I could use this to do anything that requires a secure login since the security facebook puts on their accounts is vastly stronger than anything I'd come up with.  I could use it to build a social network of bird lovers with unique and verifiable identifications.  Or perhaps a team of competitive jump ropers who fear infiltration from rival jump teams. 
4. twitter
	Allows you to use the public twittersphere as a big pile of data to parse and manipulate as you wish. 
		I could grab random examples of my friends terrible tweets and store them somewhere their parents would find them and be embarassed.  Or I could search for tweets on a topic I'm interested in (Ruby, of course), or see what's trending, or set something up to notify me when a topic is mentioned, or mentioned above it's normal threshold.

Part 2
nokogiri http://www.startupinstitute.com/rampup/ on command line stores it in @doc, then I cut and pasted into sublime, did a search from there and found 24. Looking at it now, I'm replicating the program beth did it with.
